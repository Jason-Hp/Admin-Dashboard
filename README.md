Do note there can be major improvements to this project, color schemes/font-size. 
This project is NOT suppose to be reactive/dynamic, it is mainly a project to develop heavily using CSS GRID, but it is as reactive as it can be, using min-width/minmax/etc... it is however, NOT viable to work on a smaller device like a phone.
